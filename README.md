# Assumptions
- SomeOrm - A made up tool that will create connection to MySQL server and help us query
- UI
-- One page for cart from where user checks out
-- One page after checkout to confirm and pay - this is where we will start pay out.
-- This will ensure idempotency (at max once) from users side.
- Failure protection
-- Internally our system retries till a MAX_COUNT. (At least once)
- Idempotency on PSP side
-- I am including a nonce. Many payment system use it to identify freshness of a payment request.
- DB
-- PaymentLog is an immutable table. We might think to create constrainst to revoke updates privilages.
- Config file
-- Created config.yml file to make things more secure for storing secrets and encryption technique for PSPs.
-- It can be extended in future to store many configurations that we want only our CI machines to see.
- Not built for distributed systems
- Please expect some syntactical mistakes. I have tried my best to not have any
- One flow
